# Assignment-5
1. Follow along with the in-class exercise on this, do your best to get it working, and turn in what you come up with here!

2. Be sure to include at least one test for each function or piece of functionality that should verify that your code is working!  No slacking smile, you should start writing some tests before you write your implementations (just spend a few minutes thinking about the design and then write a few tests using natural language (English is preferred for me to be able to read it smile ))

3. Create an array-based list or a linked-list (and a bonus for attempting both) that:

    1. automatically inserts values in the correct position based on some order of sorting (perhaps ascending integers or lexicographical sorting of words)

    2. efficiently searches for elements (likely binary search for the array list, but what about the linked-list?)

4. Make a chart to compare the algorithmic complexity (use Big-O notation) of your insert, remove, and search algorithms you used for your structures

Note: This assignment is to get you to think about and practice with structures that have automatically enforced properties (perhaps auto sorted, since we know sorting can be expensive... and how these might be able to be spread out over time)
